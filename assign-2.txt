Problem Statement:
Airline reservation system is a modern way and improved method in which clients can
easily access all information about flights without manual efforts. Most people now days
travel by means of air, hence this project aims at simplifying their needs by offering a
wide range of airlines and timings where they can choose from and book their travels.
The online reservation system gives all details of flight schedules, cost, time, seats and
check-in details making it easier for the traveler The outcome was implemented using
programming languages like JavaScript, html, and database management system
{Mysql}, this improved method will help solve the manual system drawbacks which
included time consuming and other manual errors. Hence it is more efficient 

 SDLC
In this project we have followed the Waterfall model. The waterfall model is the most
familiar model. This model has five phases: requirements analysis and specifications,
design, implementation and unit testing, integration and system testing, and operation and
maintenance.

1. Requirements Analysis and Specification Phase:
 The aim of this phase is to understand the exact requirements of the customer and
to document them properly. This activity is usually executed together with the
customer, as the aim is to document all functions, performance and interfacing
requirements for the software.

For the Flight Reservation Project:
Functional Requirements
User Registration and Authentication:

Users can create an account, log in, and log out.
Authentication mechanisms to ensure secure login.
Flight Search:

Users can search for flights by date, destination, and other criteria.
Display available flights with details like time, price, and airline.
Booking and Reservation:

Users can select a flight and make a reservation.
Confirmation of booking with a unique reservation ID.
Payment Processing:

Integration with payment gateways for online payments.
Handling different payment methods (credit card, debit card, etc.).
Booking Management:

Users can view, modify, or cancel their bookings.
Send booking confirmations and updates via email.
Admin Module:

Admin can add, update, or delete flight details.
View all bookings and user information.
Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

The system should handle multiple concurrent users.
Quick response time for search and booking operations.
Security:

Secure user data and payment information.
Implement encryption for sensitive data.
Scalability:

Ability to scale with increasing number of users and flights.
Usability:

User-friendly interface for both users and administrators.
Intuitive navigation and design.
Reliability:

System should be robust with minimal downtime.
Implement backup and recovery mechanisms.

2. Design phase:
The aim of this is to modify the requirements specification into a structure that is
suitable for implementation in any programming language.

For a flight reservation system, the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is an excellent choice due to its separation of concerns, which helps in organizing the codebase effectively. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the MVC pattern can be implemented in a flight reservation system using Java.

3. Implementation and Unit Testing Phase:
During testing, the major activities are concentrated around the examination and
modification of the code. Initially, small modules are tested in isolation from the rest
of the software product. The objective of unit testing is to oversee that each
independent module is correctly implemented. This gives little chance to determine
that the interface between modules is also correct, integration testing is performed.

4. Integration and System Testing Phase:'
System testing involves the testing of the whole system including the software part.
This is important to build confidence in the developers before software is delivered to
the customer or released in the market.

5. Operation and Maintenance Phase:
Software maintenance is a duty that every development group has to face, when the
software is delivered to the customerâ€™s site, installed and is operational. Therefore,
release of software initiates the operation and maintenance phase of the life cycle.
The time spent and effort required to keep the software operational after release is
very important.
